1. sign in to developer console and select skills link
2. create skill, name it, choose custom model and create skill button
3. build the interactive model for your skill 
4. select JSON editor under interaction model 
5. add code to the editor 

--------------------------------------------

* no need to build if you are changing the code, only when you make changes to alexa skill kit you have to build 
import random 
* speech_output = compliments[random.randint(0,len(compliments)-1)]
---------------------------------------------
1. give invocation name 
2. intents: what we respond with alexa, for specific intent do specific thing
3. give sample utterances for each intent 
4. create end-points (follow the steps below)
5. go to aws lambda 
6. go to give function name and iam roles 
7. go to endpoint from alexa developer console copy the aws lambda arn 
8. go to alexa skill kit under triggers go to skill id and paste there 
9. copy arn and paste in default region under endpoints 
10. save endpoints 
11. build model 
12. test 
13. for custom intent, add on custom intent, give it utterances.

main functions 

    1. build_speechlet_response(title, output, reprompt_text, should_end_session):
    2. build_response(session_attributes, speechlet_response):
    3. get_test_response():
    4. get_welcome_response():
    5. handle_session_end_request():
    6. on_session_started(session_started_request, session):
    7. on_launch(launch_request, session):
    8. on_intent(intent_request, session):
    9. on_session_ended(session_ended_request, session):
    10. lambda_handler(event, context):

1. when you call alexa, the function is invoked, 
2. the lambda_handler function is invoked which has event and context 
3. the on_session_started and on_launch is invoked 
4. when application is running, on_intent function is running at that point
5. after ending, session_ended_request is made

6. on_session_started initialize variables etc. 
7. on_intent has all the different intents which are triggered by our utterances.
8. each intent returns something
