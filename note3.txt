                                *** design of custom skills ***

for custom skills, you create the following:
    1. intent 
    2. utterances
    3. media
    4. A cloud based service (end points) 
    5. configuration


* a set of intents that represent actions that users can do with your skill. these intents represent the core functionality for your skill

* a set of sample utterances that specify the words and pharases users can say to invoke those intents. 
    you map these utterances to your intents. This mapping forms the interaction model for the skill

* an invocation name that identifies the skill. the user includes this name when initiating a conversation with your skill

* if applicable, a set of images, audio, video that you want to include in the skill. these must be stored on a publicly accessible
  site so that each item is accessible by a unique url.

*  a cloud based service that accepts these intents as structured requests and then act upon them. you provide an endpoint 
    for your service  when configuring the skill. 

* A configuration that brings all of the above together so that alexa can route requests to the service for your skill. you create this 
    configuration in the developer console

build your skill 

    * invocation : phrase users say to begin an interaction with your skill. 
    * intent: action that fulfills a user's spoken request. 
    * slots : arguments for intents. has a type that determines how alexa handles users spoken data
    * json editor: editing interaction model for your skill. 
    * Interfaces: audio player, display, gadget controller, game engine etc. 
    * endpoint: alexa sends requests to this endpoint when users invoke your skill. eg. lambda arn, https
